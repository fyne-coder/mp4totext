[SPK00 37.96-56.80] You know, change this. Depending how you want to work, you know, always we have a chat. I was asking people used a chat for questions. Don't give you want to be interrupted, just let us know that you will have a problem generally with this group. If you want to be interrupted, they will hopefully ask questions. People should just, people should just jump in if they have questions.
[SPK00 57.34-77.26] Not copy dance or real perfect. So what I thought a bit interesting before our pass of Duncan is I asked them to come on. They'd be using cloud in production for yield gold and more details for a period of time now. I thought it'd be interesting for the team here to hear their journey with him a cloud or are they?

[SPK01 129.56-132.64] I was leading data science and analytics at Casper or the mattress company.
